                <b>My child with lack of concentration!</b>
                <p class="post">
                    My son, who is in the 3rd grade of elementary school, is distracted and restless.
                    The child's grades in school are good, but he always jokes around when eating or studying, sleeps too late in the evening, and loves TV and entertainment.
                    I want my child to be calm and shy, but I don't know how to teach it.

                    It is a natural phenomenon that elementary school children have lower attention span and less endurance than adults.
                    Excessive TV or entertainment can make your child more aggressive and destructive.
                    First, get your child to lead a regular life.
                    For example, "What time and what time do you watch TV, 30 minutes a day for entertainment, and what time to go to bed?"
                    Also, it may be difficult, but when your child has to study, you also have to read a book, so that the parents can adapt to the child's timetable together. 
                    It is difficult if you tell your child to study and then watch TV.
